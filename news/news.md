Pre-assembled Fission timers should be back in stock around 2025-03-31. I'm running low on boards, but the next batch should arrive by 2025-04-11.

Preorders for the new NuclearHazard Fission are now open! More instructions, videos, and info are coming soon.

The NuclearHazard Fission has these upgrades over the Core V8:
- Built-in PoE
- Much slimmer case
- Heat-set inserts for the case lid
- Support-less case printing

The last of my stock of Core timers has sold out. I'm working on refining the replacement, called the Fission, so it will be available in kit and pre-assembled form sometime in the first week of January. I have no more plans to sell through Etsy so they'll only be available through the store page on this site.

All preorders have shipped, and I have a few extra timers in stock. These may be the last Core timers available since I can't get all the parts needed for more. Worry not though! I have a new design on the way which allows an EVEN SLIMMER case, and possibly built-in PoE!

RX modules have become very hard to obtain lately, so all my pre-built timers are out of stock and only available for preorder. I'm hoping to ship the preorders in the second week of December. Kits are still available, but make sure you can get RXs yourself before ordering.

Started accepting orders from my new shopify-based store, built into this new website! All timer variants are in stock.

Version 8 of the NuclearHazard Core timer is released. Changes are:
- Added current/voltage sensor for monitoring in the RH web interface
- Added 4 RX footprints on bottom of board so a slim version can be built without any RX carrier cards
- Slightly smaller size, new case to fit
- Rotated Pi for easier disassembly (Use a hex driver in the case slots to lift the Pi away from the connector)
