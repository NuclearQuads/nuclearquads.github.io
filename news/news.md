Started accepting orders from my new shopify-based store, built into this new website! All timer variants are in stock.

Version 8 of the NuclearHazard Core timer is released. Changes are:
- Added current/voltage sensor for monitoring in the RH web interface
- Added 4 RX footprints on bottom of board so a slim version can be built without any RX carrier cards
- Slightly smaller size, new case to fit
- Rotated Pi for easier disassembly (Use a hex driver in the case slots to lift the Pi away from the connector)
