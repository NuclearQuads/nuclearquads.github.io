# Pi Setup Script



If there are any errors, let me know so I can fix them, but also a quick google search should easily solve most of them.

The <a href="https://discord.gg/ANKd2pzBKH" target="_blank">RotorHazard discord</a> is the best place to contact me or the RotorHazard developers for help.

Note: The username on your Pi OS installation must be NuclearHazard.

This is written for the version of Pi OS released on 2023-10-10 (Bookworm) and Pi 3/4/5/Zero2 hardware. Other versions probably will give errors.

To disable the hotspot, do ```sudo systemctl disable hotspot.service```

To enable it later, do ```sudo systemctl enable hotspot.service```
