# NuclearHazard Timer

The NuclearHazard timer by NuclearQuads represents the next generation of RotorHazard timer hardware.

Currently taking pre-orders, expected to ship end of January 2024!

### Pre-Order Info:

The timers are not in stock or even produced yet. Since it's hard know how many to get manufactured, I will take preorders through the end of September. Then I'll submit them for manufacturing. I expect to have them ready to ship by January 31, 2024.
